I'm Cole, one of the co-founders of Helicone.ai. We build observability tools for LLMs, enabling companies to monitor, debug, and enhance their AI applications. While our customers often assume we're a large team given the scope of our product, the truth is we're a small group of engineers striving to keep up with our own growth. This agility has driven our product development but also highlighted the need to balance engineering with strategic sales and distribution.

Here's how my transitioning from an engineer to leading growth unfolded.

## The Comfort Zone

As an engineer, I've been comfortably nestled in what I call the "Comfort Zone." Each new ticket felt like a safe, low-risk challenge where I could relax, feeling in control as I applied familiar problem-solving patterns.

It's easy to get comfortable in the "Comfort Zone" for any role. You have a clear set of goals, a defined path, and a predictable outcome. You know how to get things done, and you have the skills to do it.

But there's a catch to this comfort. While it feels safe, it can also lead to stagnation. You might find yourself solving the same problems over and over, just in slightly different contexts. The real growth, the kind that pushes you and your company forward, often lies beyond this zone.

This is when I realized I needed to step out of my comfort zone and into what I now recognize as the "Fear Zone" - a place of uncertainty, self-doubt, and new challenges. It was time to transition from my role as an engineer to leading our growth efforts.

## The Fear Zone

The shift from the predictable world of coding to the unpredictable realm of sales was jarring. Questions like "Will this work?" and "Can I even accomplish this?" constantly echoed in my mind. My engineering background suddenly felt irrelevant. What did I know about sales and distribution?

Unlike in engineering, where I could rely on familiar patterns and problem-solving techniques, I found myself in uncharted territory. There were no clear algorithms to follow, no debuggers to help me find the issues. I had little confidence in what I was doing, but I was determined to push through, knowing it was crucial for our company's success.

Adding to the confusion was the overwhelming flood of opinions. Everyone had advice, and it was dizzying. Our plans shifted weekly, sometimes daily. One moment, outbound seemed promising; the next, SEO was the answer. Then came suggestions for YouTube, product launches, and various marketing strategies. The constant barrage of conflicting ideas left me reeling.

With so many options and contradictory advice, decision-making became paralyzing. The fear of making the wrong choice often led to inaction. I found myself stuck in analysis paralysis, unable to move forward as I weighed the potential outcomes of each possible strategy. Despite my lack of confidence, I was resolute in my commitment to figure it out, even if it meant stumbling through the process.

## The Learning Zone

Our approach to growth was, to put it mildly, chaotic. We'd jump at every suggestion, trying everything from social media campaigns to cold emails. One week we'd be all in on SEO, the next we'd pivot to product launches. It was a whirlwind of activity, but often felt like we were running in circles.

This constant shifting was exhausting and often demoralizing. We'd start something new, full of enthusiasm, only to abandon it before seeing any real results. It was a far cry from the structured, logical world of engineering I was used to.

But in this chaos, we were learning - albeit the hard way. Each failed attempt taught us something about our market, our product, and ourselves. We began to recognize patterns: what resonated with our audience and what fell flat.

Data became my new best friend. Having concrete metrics to track gave me something familiar to hold onto. It wasn't quite like debugging code, but it was a start. We could see, in black and white, what was working and what wasn't.

Gradually, a pattern emerged. Our blog posts, which we'd been consistently producing almost as an afterthought, were gaining traction. It wasn't explosive growth, but it was steady. For the first time, we had found something that seemed to work reliably.

This realization was a turning point. We started to focus more on content creation, refining our approach based on what the data told us. It wasn't an overnight transformation, but it felt like we were finally building on solid ground.

We're still pushing boundaries and tackling new challenges. But now, there's a sense of direction. The discomfort hasn't disappeared, but I'm starting to see it as a sign of growth rather than a symptom of being lost.

## The Growth Zone

The "Growth Zone" still feels distant, but I catch glimpses of it. I'm slowly developing a vision for my role in sales and distribution, finding new purpose, and feeling the motivation that comes with genuine growth.

This journey from engineering to sales and distribution is as much of a personal transformation as it is learning new skills. It's uncomfortable, yes, but that's the point. Real growth happens when we step beyond what we know and into the unknown.

To those making a similar leap: embrace the discomfort. It's a sign you're heading in the right direction. The market is our new compiler, and each small win is our new deployment. Remember, the path from the "Fear Zone" to the "Growth Zone" is not linear. You'll likely bounce between zones as you face new challenges. But with each iteration, your comfort zone expands, and what once seemed impossible becomes achievable.
