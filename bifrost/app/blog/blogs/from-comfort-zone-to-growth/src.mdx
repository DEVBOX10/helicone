I'm Cole, one of the co-founders of Helicone.ai. We build observability tools for large language models, which companies use to monitor and optimize their AI applications. While our customers often assume we're a large team given the scope of our product, the truth is we're a small group of engineers trying to keep up with our own growth.

As an engineer, I've been comfortably nestled in what I call the "Comfort Zone." Each new ticket felt like a safe, low-risk challenge where I could relax, feeling in control as I applied familiar problem-solving patterns.

But diving into sales and distribution for our startup? That catapulted me straight into the "Fear Zone." Suddenly, I faced low confidence, heavy influence from others, and a tendency to make excuses. The absence of clear starting points and lack of familiar patterns left me feeling stuck at step zero.

## The Emotional Rollercoaster of Transition

The shift from the predictable world of coding to the unpredictable realm of sales was jarring. Questions like "Will this work?" and "Can I even accomplish this?" constantly echoed in my mind. My engineering background suddenly felt irrelevant. What did I know about sales and distribution?

Adding to the confusion was the overwhelming flood of opinions. Everyone had advice, and it was dizzying. Our plans shifted weekly, sometimes daily. One moment, outbound seemed promising; the next, SEO was the answer. Then came suggestions for YouTube, product launches, and various marketing strategies. The constant barrage of conflicting ideas left me reeling.

With so many options and contradictory advice, decision-making became paralyzing. The fear of making the wrong choice often led to inaction. I found myself stuck in analysis paralysis, unable to move forward as I weighed the potential outcomes of each possible strategy.

## Finding Direction in the Chaos

Despite the challenges, I'm learning that this discomfort is a sign of progress. I'm pushing through to what I call the "Learning Zone," taking on new challenges and acquiring skills I never thought I'd need.

The key, I've discovered, is not to blindly follow others' advice. Instead, I've learned to listen to their thought process and distill it down to first principles. Understanding that their suggestions come from their specific experiences has helped me filter the noise and find my own path.

Commitment and persistence have proven crucial. We chose strategies and stuck with them for at least a month at a time. We tried everything from social media ads and LinkedIn shorts to product hunt launches and email outbound. Consistency, we found, was key to seeing results and understanding what truly works for our business.

Through our experiments, we discovered that creating content consistently drove growth. This became our focus, and we're now maximizing its potential. Each new challenge in sales and distribution has become an opportunity to extend our comfort zone and solve unfamiliar problems.

## The Path to Growth

The "Growth Zone" still feels distant, but I catch glimpses of it. I'm slowly developing a vision for my role in sales and distribution, finding new purpose, and feeling the motivation that comes with genuine growth.

This journey from engineering to sales and distribution is as much of a personal transformation as it is learning new skills. It's uncomfortable, yes, but that's the point. Real growth happens when we step beyond what we know and into the unknown.

To those making a similar leap: embrace the discomfort. It's a sign you're heading in the right direction. The market is our new compiler, and each small win is our new deployment. Remember, the path from the "Fear Zone" to the "Growth Zone" is not linear. You'll likely bounce between zones as you face new challenges. But with each iteration, your comfort zone expands, and what once seemed impossible becomes achievable.
