As seasoned developers, we've witnessed the ebb and flow of numerous tech stacks. From the meteoric rise of **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>MERN</span>** to the gradual decline of **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>AngularJS</span>**, and the innovative emergence of Jamstack, tech stacks have been the backbone of web development evolution.

In this blog, we will walk through the modern **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>LLM Stack</span>** - an emerging tech stack that is changing how developers build and scale Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

Before you continue, please first read the companion blog on [The Evolution of LLM Architecture](/blog/building-an-llm-stack). 


## The Evolution of LLM Applications

2023 marked the rise of LLMs and their applications, with **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</span>** emerging as the most popular use case. RAG involves using data retrieved from vector databases as context for LLMs to generate human-readable responses.

As we progress through 2024, we're witnessing advancements in implementation strategies. Key trends include:

- Increased focus on production-ready LLM applications
- Growing emphasis on observability and data versioning
- Introduction of enterprise features to foundational components


## Why a New Stack for LLM Applications?

LLM applications, powered by pre-trained models, are deceptively simple to kickstart, but scaling them unveils unique challenges in machine learning and data processing:

1. **Platform Limitations**: Traditional stacks struggle with LLM app demands, especially when dealing with real-time data pipelines.
2. **Tooling Gaps**: Existing tools often fall short in managing LLM-specific workflows, including **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>prompt engineering</span>** and efficient API calls.
3. **Observability Hurdles**: Monitoring LLM performance requires specialized solutions for tracking **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>embedding models</span>** and external API usage.
4. **Security Concerns**: LLMs introduce new vectors for data breaches and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>prompt injections</span>**, necessitating robust data processing protocols.

## Anatomy of the LLM Stack

**Rather than prescribing a specific stack choice, this blog will outline the <span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>key components for building a robust LLM stack</span>.** We'll explore how these components work together to create powerful AI applications that enhance user experience.

Let's dissect the architecture of the LLM stack mentioned in our companion blog post:

1. **Observability Layer**
2. **Inference Layer**
3. **Testing & Experimentation Layer**
